## How was it to work after a defined class diagram like this, is it helpful or is it hard to follow the thoughts of the designer?
It is helpful up to a point, but diagrams made by someone else add a new layer of abstraction, where i gotta think like the designer did.
And for the most part a well designed diagram is what a developer wants
to follow anyway, but it is overcomplicated to see so much in one go.



## Elaborate on the difference between inheritance, composition, interface and abstract classes.
Interfaces are similar to small lego blocks, every class using that
interface has to use those blocks as foundation to build on top of.
Inheritance is used when many classes share things in common, these
classes would have one parent class which they get common functionalities
and methods from.
Abstract classes are like interfaces, they provide methods for other classes
to implement as needed.
Composition is a way to achieve inheritance, but in more flexible manner.
Using composition allows classes to just be "part" of the inheritance,
instead of "being" it. Classes "have" a composition, instead of "are" an
inheritance.


## Do you think the class diagram is balanced for this application, or would you like to propose any modifications to the class diagram?





## Are you satisied with your code or do you see improvement areas for it?


## What was the hardest part(s) to understand while building this application?


## Did you do the optional part, if so, describe how it works and elaborate on how you solved it.
